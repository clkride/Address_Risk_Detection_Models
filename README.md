# About Dataset

 * **Title**: Insurance Underwriting Mocked Dataset (with social/economic context)
 * **Overview** : This dataset is a simulated and fictitious collection of data designed for demonstration purposes in the context of insurance underwriting. The columns provide information related to policyholders and relevant factors influencing underwriting decisions.
 * **Internal Sources**
   
   1. Policyholder Information: Internal records of policyholders maintained by the insurance company.
   2. Payment History: Internal data reflecting the payment history of policyholders.
   3. Legal Issues Database: Internal database tracking historical legal issues related to policyholders.
  
  * **External Sources**
    1. Crime Rate Data: External datasets from local law enforcement agencies or public sources providing crime rate information.
    2. Income and Home Value Data: External sources such as government census data or real estate databases for average income and home values.
    3. Population Density Data: External datasets from demographic studies or government records.
    4. Catastrophe Risk Indicators: External sources providing information on natural disaster risks in specific regions.

  * **Data Sample**
    Here's a sample of the first few records in the dataset:
